### The `nimcli` Repository

This repository contains the build scripts for the DigitalOcean-specific build of `nimbella-cli`.

The `nimbella-cli` repo itself is open source and its build is more generic.  The scripts here reach into that repo to do the build in a more tailored wsay.

The internal build options are described in initial comments in `build.sh` in this repository.
